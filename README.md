<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A software supply chain attack is when malicious code is added into trusted hardware and software. An attack doesn't only refer to the code that is committed by your developers, it can also refer to code from:

- Dependencies/packages
- Code written by external parties for your company
- Web APIs/services called by your codebase

With this in mind you may be asking what can possibly be done to protect your codebase? Yubico’s various products can be leveraged in ways that can help you protect your solutions. In this series we will explore different attack scenarios, and step-by-step instructions on how to mitigate the risk using account protection, commit signing, and code signing techniques.
