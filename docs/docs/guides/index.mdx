# Role based guides

This section contains various guides that can help you quickly bootstrap protections for code repositories.

The **administrator** guide focuses on the settings and configurations that administrators can add to your source control tool to prevent unwanted access, and require the use of commit signing.

The **developer** guide focuses on teaching developers how they can use their YubiKey to create SSH keys. These keys will handle both authentication and commit signing in order to ensure a seamless experience that wonâ€™t hinder their productivity.

The **deployments** guide will demonstrate various ways that you can enable code signing on your executables and scripts.
